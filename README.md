# Calendar-MVP
Calendar-MVP is a service that is meant to solve unorganized carpooling and mayhem within an organization/community. This app organizes drivers and riders neatly into "cars", and allows poolers of each car to communicate only and directly with each other in order clearly relay important carpool information, such as time changes. This application features a clickable event calendar, a ridesharing form, clickable embedded google map images, displaying the pick up location of a carpool driver, and in app Twilio Programmable Chat.

## Installation

1. Sign up for a google maps API account, enable Maps Embed API, Geocoding API, and Distance Matrix Api, and then copy your API key

1. Create a copy of the config.example.js file, save it as config.js, and assign your Google Maps API key, as a string, to geocodeAPI_Key.

1. Sign up for a Twilio account, and gather account information according to this [link](https://www.twilio.com/docs/chat/javascript/quickstart).
